<p class="message">
  I still remember the hum of the lab at the
  Institute of Computing and Systems of
  Aguascalientes, where I first learned that a
  well-placed breakpoint could turn chaos into
  clarity.
</p>

That curiosity carried me through a Technical Degree in
Programming Analyst, a high-school specialization in Informatics,
and a Bachelor's in Strategic Information Systems. Over the last
eight years, it has become the throughline of a career spent
building data-heavy systems that behave under pressure.

Today I work as a Software Engineer at F5, partnering with Data
Science, Threat Research, and Bot Defense teams to build security
products that sift through global traffic and surface the signals
that matter. I move between Google Cloud services like Cloud Run,
BigQuery, and Cloud Storage, Flask backends, React frontends, and
PostgreSQL datasets to keep those pipelines resilient and
observable.

Before F5, I shipped full-stack platforms for industries that
measure downtime in millions: digital twins for water utilities at
Autodesk, smart-building automation for Siemens, healthcare
workflow orchestration for Auxita, wind-turbine analytics for GE
Renewable Energy, and intercompany finance tooling for BlackLine.
Each project sharpened my instinct for marrying clean interfaces
with dependable cloud-native infrastructure on AWS or GCP.

Somewhere along the way, Linux became my charismatic
co-pilot on every deployment. From stewarding healthcare
platforms with Linux server administration to shipping
Dockerized pipelines in the cloud, its prompt keeps me honest,
curious, and grinning whenever a new cursor blinks back.

When the last log line scrolls by, I like to think Linux is
giving a quiet nod before the next story begins.
